# Aseprite Palettes for GB Studio 🎨

These are the colors [GB Studio](https://gbstudio.dev/) uses when interpreting PNG files as [GameBoy sprites and tiles](https://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/GBDK_Sprite_Tutorial).
This repository exists primarily so that I can easily install these palettes after installing Aseprite.


## Format 📜

They are stored here in the text `gpl` format that [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) accepts as built-in palettes (i.e., the [GNU Image Manipulation Program palette format](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-palettes.html)).
Note that this is different than the binary `.aseprite` format that Aseprite exports and which are provided by the official [GB Studio documentation](https://gbstudio.dev/docs/sprites/).


## Installation 📁

To install these, copy the entire content of this repository to `<Application Path>\Aseprite\data\extensions\gb-studio-palettes`, where `<Application Path>` is the install location of Aseprite on your machine.
